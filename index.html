                    <p> My name is Bernardo Luckmann dos Santos, I'm a software developer from Est√¢ncia Velha, Brazil looking for a new job. 
                        I started my career just out of highschool, when I got a job at Cyncly as a trainee in software development, where I worked for a year and four months. 
                        At that time, I worked with many people and got experience in database management, Oracle PL/SQL and Git.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Outside of work and coding experience, I have a basic understanding of the Spanish language and fluency in English.
                    <br>
                    <br>    
                        As I'm currently unemployed, I will be doing projects to have a better understanding of coding and design concepts, so this website will be regularly updated with my newest creations and updates to already made stuff.
